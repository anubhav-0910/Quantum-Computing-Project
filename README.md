# Quantum Computing Project

This repository contains tutorials and implementations of two fundamental quantum computing algorithms: Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and Grover's algorithm for unstructured search.

## Shor's Algorithm for Integer Factorization

Shor's algorithm, formulated by Peter Shor in 1994, is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization. It is particularly notable for its potential to factor large integers efficiently, which has significant implications for cryptography and security.
